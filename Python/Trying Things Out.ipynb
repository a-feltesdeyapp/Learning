    "Code Review from Copilot.\n",
    "> Great job! Your solution for the Library Book Borrowing System is well-structured and follows Pythonic practices. Here’s a quick review and some suggestions for further improvement:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Functions are clearly defined for each task (listing, printing, selecting, borrowing).\n",
    "> * Input validation is handled for both age and book selection.\n",
    "> * The use of a list of lists to track book titles and availability is appropriate.\n",
    "> * The borrowing loop and exit conditions are clear and user-friendly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Suggestions for improvement:\n",
    "> * File Handling: Use a context manager `(with open(...) as file:)` to automatically close the file after reading.\n",
    "> * Type Checking: Instead of `type(book_number) == \"string\"`, use `isinstance(book_number, str)`.\n",
    "> * Magic Numbers: Consider defining constants for values like the minimum age and max checkouts for clarity.\n",
    "> * Separation of Concerns: You could further modularize by separating user interaction (input/print) from logic, making it easier to test.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Overall:\n",
    "> Your implementation is correct and Pythonic for the scenario. If you want to practice further, try adding features like returning books, saving the updated availability to a file, or handling multiple users in a session.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Let me know if you want to review or refactor any part of your code, or if you’d like a new scenario to try!\n",
