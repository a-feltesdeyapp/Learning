    "The Pythonic Style uses the following guidelines\n",
    "* Variables and Function names are written using snake_case (e.g., total_price, get_user_name)\n",
    "* Class names are written using CamelCase (e.g., MyClass)\n",
    "* Write clear, descriptive names for variables, functions and classes.\n",
    "* Use indentation (4 spaces per level) and avoid tabs.\n",
    "* Keep lines under 79 characters\n",
    "* Use spaces around operators and after commas\n",
    "* Write concise, readable code. Simplicity > Cleverness\n",
    "* Use docstrings and comments to explain complex code\n",
    "    * docstrings are a special string used for documenting. It's placed as the first statement inside a definition and enclosed in tripple quotes (''' or \"\"\").\n",
    "    * It explains what the function, class, or module does and can be accessed using `help()` or the `.doc` attribute\n",
    "* Parentheses are not required for simple conditions in Python. Use them only for grouping or clarity in complex expressions.\n",
    "* Avoid unnecessary code and repetition (DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.)\n",
    "* Follow PEP 8, the official Python style guide, for more details."
