## Course Description

This course provides an introductory exploration of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML v2) and its applications in the field of systems engineering, specifically focusing on Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Learn to leverage SysML for modeling complex systems, focusing on requirements analysis, system behavior, and structural modeling. Through hands-on exercises, the course enables you to design and analyze system architectures effectively. By the end of the course, you should be well-equipped to use SysML to communicate system design, verify requirements, and improve the development process in their MBSE projects. This course is ideal for engineers, project managers, and anyone involved in the design and development of complex systems.
